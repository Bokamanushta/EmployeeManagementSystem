# Employee Management System

This mini project is about “Employee Management System” which will help the admin or owner of the company to manage employees in a company. In this system, we will implement the concept of Linked List and Queue. Admin will be able to search any employee by name, salary or even position. Besides, Admin can also give retirement to most senior employees if there occurs any employee overflow or the employee reaches the retirement age. Basically, the rules are simple, the first person entering the organization will be terminated in that case. Here, we will use a queue to do so. Moreover, the admin will be able to see performance of employees to promote or increase salary based on the performance. In addition, Admin can approve the leave on applications of employees. He can also record the medical report of a particular application if he wants. Lastly, the admin will be able to see the reports of employees. The system is aimed to make the management task of an admin easy, convenient and effective.
